            <h1>Aboute Artificial Inetelligent</h1>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to simulate human-like intelligence, enabling them to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It works by using algorithms to process vast amounts
                of data to recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt their behavior to achieve specific goals. Common applications include virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars. </p>
            <p>Simulates human intelligence: AI is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Learns from data: AI systems process large sets of data to learn, identify patterns,
                and improve over time without explicit human programming. Key components: AI relies on computational systems, data management, and advanced algorithms to function. Perceives and acts: AI systems can perceive their environment, process
                information, and take action to achieve a goal. Examples of AI applications Healthcare: AI helps doctors analyze medical images faster. Finance: AI is used to detect unusual activities and improve security. E-commerce and entertainment:
                AI powers recommendation systems for movies and products. Transportation: AI is the technology behind self-driving cars. Customer service: AI is used in chatbots and voice recognition for customer support. Important considerations AI is
                a powerful technology that can simplify complex tasks and assist in solving major challenges. However, its development raises ethical, privacy, and employment concerns that need responsible guidelines.

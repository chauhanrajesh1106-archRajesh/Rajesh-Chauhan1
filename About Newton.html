            <h1>Short Interoductionof Newton</h1>
            <p>Sir Isaac Newton was an English physicist, mathematician, and astronomer who was a pivotal figure in the Scientific Revolution. He is most famous for his laws of motion, the law of universal gravitation, and co-inventing calculus. </p>
            <p> Newton's work established the foundation for classical mechanics and his discoveries in optics, such as the decomposition of white light into a spectrum of colors, also made him one of the most influential scientists in history. </p>

            <p>Key contributions Physics: He formulated the three laws of motion, which describe the relationship between an object and the forces acting upon it. He also developed the theory of universal gravitation, explaining that the same force that
                causes an apple to fall to the ground also keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. Mathematics: Newton developed calculus independently of Gottfried Leibniz, providing a powerful new tool for understanding change and motion. </p>

            <h1>Interoduction of Albert Einstein</h1>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist born in 1879, most famous for developing the theory of relativity and the equation \(E=mc^{2}\). He won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect, and his theories
                laid the foundation for modern physics. After moving to the United States in the 1930s, he became a strong advocate for peace and civil rights. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Scientific contributions: Einstein's most significant contributions include the special and general theories of relativity and his explanation of the photoelectric effect. The mass-energy equivalence formula, \(E=mc^{2}\), is one of the most
                famous equations in the world.&nbsp; </p>

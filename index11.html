    <hr>
    <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 153); font-style: italic;">Gautam Buddha, born Siddhartha Gautama, was an ancient Indian spiritual teacher and the founder of Buddhism. He renounced his royal life to seek enlightenment, which he attained under the Bodhi tree. His teachings, including the Four Noble Truths
        and the Eightfold Path, form the foundation of Buddhism and aim to end suffering. Early life and renunciation Born a prince: Siddhartha Gautama was born a prince in what is now Nepal, to King Suddhodana and Queen Maya of the Shakya clan around
        566 BC. Sheltered life: He was raised in luxury and sheltered from the realities of suffering. Witnessing suffering: At age 29, he left the palace and encountered an old man, a sick man, and a corpse, which prompted his quest for a way to end
        suffering. Renunciation: He left his family and princely life to become a wandering ascetic, a journey known as the Mahabhishkramana. </p>

This is when he became known as the Buddha, or "the awakened one". The Four Noble Truths:

        and severe asceticism. First sermon: His first sermon was delivered at Sarnath, near Varanasi, to his first five disciples.Founder of Buddhism: His teachings spread throughout the Ganges plain, and he established a monastic community (the sangha).
        Enduring religion: His life and teachings form the basis of Buddhism, which remains a major world religion today. Death: The Buddha died around 483 BC in Kushinagar, India. </p>
